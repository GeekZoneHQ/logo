While we don't want to be corporate and stuffy, it is important to us that we are represented in the right way as this helps others to find us. This guide will help you do that correctly!

The Geek.Zone logo can be used to show affiliation with Geek.Zone or when something is being run by Geek.Zone. In either case, it should be included with a link to an appropriate page on Geek.Zone, such as an article, or at very least Geek.Zone itself. You are free to use these images as long as you credit Geek.Zone, including a link to http://Geek.Zone, and share them under the
The Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Publications that are designed by Geek.Zone members, for and on behalf of Geek.Zone, do not need to provide attribution.




<!-- Extra sections -->
<!--- OPTIONAL -->
<!--- This should not be called "Extra Sections". -->
<!--- This is a space for 0 or more sections to be included, -->
<!--- each of which must have their own titles. -->


## Name
Just to be clear, the Geek.Zone name should be used in the following ways.

Our name is verbally said, "geek zone". In writing, it must always be written as

> Geek.Zone

Note the capital G and capital Z, as well as the `.` that separates the two words, not a space.

This links the name to our website and makes it look a bit more geeky, which is always a good thing.

When writing about one of our Districts, their names should be stylised as follows;
* Geek.Zone/Coventry
* Geek.Zone/Chelmsford
* Geek.Zone/London

When referring to the organisation, it is best to use the general form, for example;
* "Geek.Zone is"¦"
* "Jane from Geek.Zone spoke at the event"
* "Geek.Zone has"¦"

When writing about one of our community centres, one should use the singular form, for example,
* "The Geek.Zone in Coventry has..."
* "Every Geek.Zone is..."
* "John went to the Geek.Zone"

We sometimes verbally use the term "geekzoners" to describe members. In writing, however, those with Geek.Zone membership should be referred to as "Geek.Zone Members".

We ask that the following terms are not used in writing as they could lead to confusion.
* Geek.Zones
* Geek.Zoner
* Geek.Zoners

Having led with the desire to avoid stuffiness, this all ds sound a little stuffy! This is because, however, these measures prevent ambiguaty.
This is due to the fact that the following [gTLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain) do not exist.

* .zones
* .zoner
* .zoners

Using one of these terms might cause people to think that you are referring to a website, then get frustrated when the 
link is appears to be "broken". For example, a popular travel provider ran a campaign that mentioned the non-existent 
"[.yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO56QVAR1Qc)" gTLD. Since it was in the closing "call to action" section of 
the advert, it was all that many people remembered. This led to 
[tremendous confusion](https://www.billhartzer.com/domain-names/people-confuse-new-gtld-domains-com-domains/) as well 
as loss of custom, so they subsequently decided to pull the advert after lots of time and money wasted. If you like 
Geek.Zone enough to write about us, please help others to find us by ensuring that they are not sucked into the same 
trap!

## Logo
### Main Logo
This is the official, main Geek.Zone logo

| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_y100bg_CMYK.ai](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_y100bg_CMYK.ai) | AI     | CMYK   | Print publications, such as banners     |
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_yellow.png](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_yellow.png)                                                              | PNG    | RGB    | Web, such as social media               |

Here"™s a variation that includes the "Geek.Zone" text.

| Filename                                                                                                   | Format | Varient           | Colour | Usage                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent_text_CMYK.ai](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent_text_CMYK.ai) | AI     | Transparent       | CMYK   | Print publications, such as banners |
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_y100bg__text_CMYK.ai](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_y100bg__text_CMYK.ai)                                                          | AI     | Yellow Background | CMYK   | Print publications, such as banners |


We also have these in handy dandy web sizes.

| Filename        | Format | Size              |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| [leaderboard.png](images/2017/leaderboard.png) | PNG    | leaderboard |


### Transparent
This is useful when the background is both light enough to make the black outline visible, and important enough to need to be seen through the logo.

| Filename                                       | Filetype |
|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent.svg](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent.svg)     | SVG      |
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent_CMYK.ai](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent_CMYK.ai) | AI       |
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent.png](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent.png)     | PNG      |

### Red & Yellow

This variation is great when the background is dark or the publication colours are particularly vibrant.

| Filename                                                                                                                   | Filetype |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent_red-yellow.svg](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_clean_transparent_red-yellow.svg) | SVG      |
| [logo_MAIN_triangle_transparent_red-yellow.png](images/2017/logo_MAIN_triangle_transparent_red-yellow.png)               | PNG      |

## Fonts
Titles should be writen in Impact.

Body text should be written in Garamond.

Highlighted body text should be written in Courier New.

> We are eager to update this with some modern open source fonts, so please PR if you have any suggestions.

## Colours
We use the 100% colour pallet to keep everything nice and easy.

| Colour | Hex     | RGB         | CMYK            |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Yellow | #FFFF00 | 255,255,000 | 000,000,100,000 |
| Red    | #FF0000 | 255,000,000 | 000,100,100,000 |
| Black  | #000000 | 000,000,000 | 000,000,000,100 |

## URL Style

When displaying URLs on Geek.Zone printed or digital signage, do not include `http://www.`. Our webserver ds this automatically,
so it looks untidy. Furthermore, CamelCase should be utilised where possible.

For example.

`https://www.geek.zone/cov`

should be displayed as

`Geek.Zone/Cov`

Equally, the shortened form of URLs should be used where possible, so for example

`http://www.facebook.com/geekzonecov`

should be displayed as

`fb.com/GeekZoneCov`
